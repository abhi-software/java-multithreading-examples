## Thread Basics

### Thread Creation and Lifecycle

Create threads by extending the `Thread` class or implementing the `Runnable` interface. Understand the lifecycle states: new, runnable, blocked, waiting, timed waiting, and terminated.

## Thread Synchronization

### Synchronized Methods and Blocks

Use the `synchronized` keyword to ensure mutually exclusive access to critical sections of code. Utilize the `volatile` keyword and atomic classes for thread-safe operations.

## Locks and Concurrent Collections

### ReentrantLock

Provide advanced control over locking using `ReentrantLock`. Use `ReadWriteLock` for concurrent read and exclusive write access. Leverage concurrent collection classes.

## Executor Framework

Utilize `ExecutorService` and `ThreadPoolExecutor` for managing and controlling the execution of tasks by a pool of worker threads.

## Fork-Join Framework

Employ the `ForkJoinPool` for parallel processing, especially for recursive tasks.

## Thread Communication

### Wait and Notify

Coordinate activities between threads using `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()`. Implement synchronization with `CountDownLatch` and `CyclicBarrier`.

## Thread Safety and Best Practices

### Immutable Objects

Design classes to be immutable to simplify concurrency. Avoid deadlocks and follow best practices for writing thread-safe code.

## Java Memory Model

Understand the basics of how memory is managed in a multithreaded environment, including the happens-before relationship.

## Parallel Streams

Utilize parallel streams for concurrent processing of collections.


## Asynchronous Programming

Use the `CompletableFuture` class and the `CompletionStage` interface for asynchronous programming.
